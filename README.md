## How to Play:
1. execute the correct binary according to your operating system
2. click the start button
3. choose male or female, then follow through with a choice of weight - this will effect the calculations of B.A.C.
4. choose what drinks to drink, or choose to socialize/dance. Watch the effect on B.A.C. (please note: there is a bug where it will only calculate up to three hours, anything past won’t lower the BAC)
5. When ready, click “drive home”
6. This will load the driving portion of the game. Depending on your B.A.C, you will notice the car will drift, sway, and be unresponsive. Try to drive as long as you possibly can by avoiding the red obstacles (they have lights so they’re easier to see!). Hitting 5 obstacles will result in losing the game! 

Note: There is no “winning” per se. The # of obstacles passed is presented at the end for personal score, however it is not saved. This was intentional; we did not want to encourage any positive association with drunk driving. The lesson is that you never win when you drink and drive.
